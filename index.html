        <span class="subheader-text">About Me</span>
        <div class="about-section-content">
          <div class="body-text">I recently graduated from Purdue University with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering.  Finishing with honors, I spent most of my time as an undergraduate studying the many aspects of circuits, systems, and signals while participating in various software and hardware projects.  Professionally, I began by interning at large corporations where I supported development by providing data analysis and tools to automate processes.  I went on to help launch a small start-up where we developed a high-fidelity drone simulator, a data collection device with an app, and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).  The UAV was the main development focus; we researched and developed technology which won 4th in a DOD contract competition out of thousands of defense contractors.</div>
          <div class="body-text">I have always had a passion for learning and an insatiable curiosity.  From teaching myself the basics of electronics and programming at a young age to initiating research projects at Purdue, I'm always looking to innovate and create.  When I'm not hiking or spending time with my cat, you can find me reading books, articles, and papers on new ideas and concepts.  The well of human knowledge runs deep, and I can't help but dive right in!</div>
