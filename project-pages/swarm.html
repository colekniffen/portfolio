          <div class="body-text">The first club I joined at Purdue University was the Aerial Robotics Team.  This club develops an autonomous drone for the AUVSI SUAS competition each year where drones compete to autonomously complete specific objectives including payload drops, object detection, and collision avoidance.  The main issue the team faced during development was simulating the many algorithms that needed to be tested.  One of my colleagues (the founder of Codex Labs) and I had the idea to greatly simplify the process of testing these algorithms by developing a cloud-based simulation platform.  We partnered with a Purdue professor, a primary stakeholder, to create a vertically integrated project (VIP) which allowed us to expand the team and develop the technology during school.</div>
          <div class="body-text">The simulation engine, SWARM, is based off Microsoft's AirSim.  This powerful tool is built using Unreal Engine to create realistic environments for testing and data collection.  Developers have complete control over vehicle configuration, data acquisition, and algorithms to decrease system development time.  After generating the initial system requirements and doing market research, I led development of the web-portal and cloud infrastructure.  I obtained valuable hands-on experience with React, Ruby, and AWS while learning about different controls algorithms.  For more information and videos, check out the links below!</div>
